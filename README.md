# Catalog
###### Personal Project (WIP)
Catalog is an application to help with personal collection organization and planning. Its original intentions were to catalog clothing and accessories, it's flexible enough to apply to all sorts of items (stationery, supplies, etc). I've personally wanted an app that made it easy to do this, and while I tried a few available on the Apple App Store, none of them really fit all my desires, so why not just make my own!

## Proposed Features
* Store items in a main catalog
  - Items are required to have at least one image
    - Additional images are allowed (save a detailed shot, or keep a picture to remember how the item fits)
  - Add a description
  - Add tags
    - Tags are crucial to the organization of catalog.
    - While they aren't required, they're highly encouraged so specific items are easy to find
* Filtering!!
  - Filter the catalog by any combination of user tags.
  - Allow for specific logic to be used
    - ie. Fit all tags (top && blue && long-sleeve), or just some (red || pink || dress || skirt)
* Collections & Sub-Collections
  - Allow items to be combined to specific collections
    - ie. "Favorite outfits" collection, within are sub-collections of items that make a great outfit.
    - ie. "Outfit ideas" collection, within are sub-collections of items that might be an interesting outfit to try.
    - ie. "Color Combinations" collection, within are sub-collections of brush pen colors that look good together.
    
### Features to consider
* Multiple catalogs per-user
  - PROs: Instead of having a mixed catalog of totally different objects (clothing, stationery), they're conveniently separated.
  - CONs: ???
